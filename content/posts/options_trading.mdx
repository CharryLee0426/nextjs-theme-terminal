## 1. Introduction to Options

An option is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before an expiration date. Options are widely used by investors for hedging, income generation, and speculation[1][2].

### Why Trade Options?

- **Leverage**: Control a larger position with less capital
- **Flexibility**: Multiple strategies for different market outlooks
- **Income**: Generate premiums through selling options
- **Protection**: Hedge existing stock positions
- **Defined Risk**: Know your maximum loss upfront (in many strategies)

### Key Statistics

- Retail traders lost over USD 2 billion in options premium from 2019 to 2021[1]
- The most traded stock options are Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA)[1]
- Many out-of-the-money options expire worthless[1]

---

## 2. Basic Concepts

### Call Options

A **call option** gives the buyer the right to purchase an underlying asset at the strike price before expiration[2].

**Key Characteristics:**
- Buyer pays premium upfront
- Buyer profits if stock price rises above strike + premium
- Seller (writer) profits if stock stays below strike price
- Maximum loss for buyer = premium paid
- Maximum profit for seller = premium received

**Real Example - Tesla Call:**
- Current TSLA price: $250
- Buy 1 call option: Strike $260, Premium $5 (or $500 per contract)
- Expiration: 30 days
- Break-even at expiration: $265
- Maximum loss: $500
- Maximum profit: Unlimited

### Put Options

A **put option** gives the buyer the right to sell an underlying asset at the strike price before expiration[2].

**Key Characteristics:**
- Buyer pays premium upfront
- Buyer profits if stock price falls below strike - premium
- Seller profits if stock stays above strike price
- Maximum loss for buyer = premium paid
- Maximum profit for seller = premium received (but limited to strike price)

**Real Example - Apple Put:**
- Current AAPL price: $230
- Buy 1 put option: Strike $220, Premium $3 (or $300 per contract)
- Expiration: 30 days
- Break-even at expiration: $217
- Maximum loss: $300
- Maximum profit: $20,000 (if AAPL goes to $0)

### Greeks: The Risk Metrics

Options prices don't move 1:1 with stock price. Understanding the Greeks helps traders predict price movements:

| Greek | Meaning | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Delta | Rate of change in option price vs stock price | 0 to 1 (calls), -1 to 0 (puts) |
| Gamma | Rate of change in Delta | Affects Delta stability |
| Theta | Time decay (loss per day) | Negative for buyers, positive for sellers |
| Vega | Sensitivity to volatility changes | Higher IV = Higher option prices |
| Rho | Sensitivity to interest rates | Less important for short-term trades |

## 3. Single Leg Strategies (One-Legged)

### Strategy 1: Long Call (Bullish)

**Outlook:** Moderately to very bullish

**Description:** Buy a call option, expecting the stock price to rise above the strike price plus the premium paid[2].

**Setup:**
- Buy 1 call option
- Pay premium upfront
- Choose strike price based on target price

**Profit/Loss Profile:**

See Chart 1: Long Call Strategy P&L (chart:11)

The chart shows:
- **Maximum Loss:** Premium paid ($200 in example)
- **Maximum Gain:** Unlimited
- **Break-even:** Strike price + Premium paid ($110 + $2 = $112)
- **Profit Zone:** Stock price above $112 at expiration

**Real Example:**
- Current price: $100
- Buy 1 call: Strike $110, Premium $2 per share ($200 total)
- Scenario 1: Stock rises to $120 at expiration → Profit: $800
- Scenario 2: Stock stays at $100 → Loss: $200
- Scenario 3: Stock falls to $90 → Loss: $200 (max loss)

**When to Use:**
- You expect a significant price increase
- Volatility is expected to increase
- You want leveraged exposure with limited downside

**Advantages:**
- Limited risk (premium paid)
- Unlimited profit potential
- Capital efficient

**Disadvantages:**
- Time decay works against you
- Requires stock to move above break-even
- Premium paid is lost if stock doesn't rise enough

---

### Strategy 2: Long Put (Bearish)

**Outlook:** Moderately to very bearish

**Description:** Buy a put option, expecting the stock price to fall below the strike price minus the premium paid[2].

**Setup:**
- Buy 1 put option
- Pay premium upfront
- Choose strike price below current price

**Profit/Loss Profile:**
- **Maximum Loss:** Premium paid
- **Maximum Gain:** (Strike price × 100) - Premium paid
- **Break-even:** Strike price - Premium paid
- **Profit Zone:** Stock price below break-even at expiration

**Real Example:**
- Current price: $100
- Buy 1 put: Strike $95, Premium $2 per share ($200 total)
- Scenario 1: Stock falls to $80 at expiration → Profit: $1,300
- Scenario 2: Stock stays at $100 → Loss: $200
- Scenario 3: Stock rises to $110 → Loss: $200 (max loss)

**When to Use:**
- You expect a significant price decrease
- You want to bet against a stock
- Market volatility is expected to increase

**Advantages:**
- Limited risk (premium paid)
- Profit potential if market drops
- Simple to understand and execute

**Disadvantages:**
- Time decay works against you
- Requires stock to move below break-even
- Expensive to buy protective puts far out-of-the-money

---

### Strategy 3: Covered Call (Income)

**Outlook:** Neutral to mildly bullish

**Description:** Own the stock and sell a call option against it. This generates income (premium) while capping your upside potential[2].

**Setup:**
- Own 100+ shares of stock
- Sell 1 call per 100 shares
- Call strike is typically above current price (out-of-the-money)

**Real Example:**
- Own 100 shares of Microsoft at $380
- Sell 1 call: Strike $400, Premium $5 per share ($500 total)
- Scenario 1: Stock stays at $380 or below at expiration
  - You keep the stock and the $500 premium
  - Return on investment: $500 / $38,000 = 1.3%
- Scenario 2: Stock rises to $420 at expiration
  - Your shares get called away at $400
  - Profit: ($400 - $380) × 100 + $500 = $2,500
  - Maximum profit is capped
- Scenario 3: Stock falls to $360 at expiration
  - You keep the stock and the $500 premium
  - This premium helps offset losses

**When to Use:**
- You own stock long-term and want additional income
- You're willing to sell the stock if it rises significantly
- You expect mild to no price movement
- Market is range-bound

**Advantages:**
- Generates income from existing holdings
- Reduces cost basis of stock
- Easier to sustain losses through premium collection
- Lower risk than owning stock outright

**Disadvantages:**
- Caps your upside profit potential
- Still exposed to significant downside losses
- Called away from stock during a strong rally

## 4. Multi-Leg Strategies

### Strategy 4: Protective Put (Hedging)

**Outlook:** Neutral to bullish with downside protection

**Description:** Own stock and buy a put option to protect against significant losses. Also called "married put" or "portfolio insurance"[2].

**Setup:**
- Own 100+ shares of stock
- Buy 1 put per 100 shares
- Put strike is typically at or near support level

**Profit/Loss Profile:**

See Chart 2: Protective Put Strategy P&L (chart:12)

The chart illustrates:
- **Maximum Loss:** (Stock price at purchase - Put strike price) + Put premium paid
- **Maximum Gain:** Unlimited
- **Break-even:** Stock purchase price + Put premium
- **Protection Floor:** Put strike price (can't lose more than put cost below strike)

**Real Example:**
- Own 100 shares of Apple at $230
- Buy 1 put: Strike $220, Premium $5 per share ($500 total)
- Stock currently trades at $230
- Scenario 1: Stock falls to $200 at expiration
  - Without protection: Loss of $3,000
  - With protection: Loss of $500 (put premium) + $0 (capped by $220 strike)
  - Total loss: Only $500
- Scenario 2: Stock rises to $250 at expiration
  - Profit: ($250 - $230) × 100 - $500 = $1,500
  - Put expires worthless but provided insurance
- Scenario 3: Stock stays at $230
  - Loss: Put premium ($500)
  - Think of it as insurance cost

**When to Use:**
- You own stock but fear a temporary correction
- You want to preserve gains but stay invested
- Earnings announcement is coming (high volatility risk)
- Market uncertainty is high

**Advantages:**
- Provides downside protection with defined maximum loss
- Maintains unlimited upside potential
- Peace of mind during volatile periods
- Can enable more aggressive position sizing

**Disadvantages:**
- Put premium is a sunk cost if stock rallies
- Reduces overall returns in bull markets
- Expensive when volatility is already high
- Ongoing cost if you want continuous protection

---

### Strategy 5: Bull Call Spread (Bullish with Limited Risk)

**Outlook:** Moderately bullish

**Description:** Buy an in-the-money or at-the-money call, then sell a higher-strike out-of-the-money call. This reduces your cost and limits profit potential[2].

**Setup:**
- Buy 1 call at lower strike (pay premium)
- Sell 1 call at higher strike (receive premium)
- Both calls expire on same date
- Same underlying asset

**Profit/Loss Profile:**

See Chart 3: Bull Call Spread P&L (chart:13)

**Real Example - Using Tesla:**
- Current TSLA price: $250
- Buy 1 call: Strike $250, Premium $12 per share ($1,200)
- Sell 1 call: Strike $260, Premium $7 per share ($700)
- Net Debit: $1,200 - $700 = $500 per spread
- Scenario 1: TSLA stays at $250 at expiration
  - Loss: $500 (premium paid)
- Scenario 2: TSLA rises to $255 at expiration
  - Profit: ($255 - $250) × 100 - $500 = $0 (break-even near)
- Scenario 3: TSLA rises to $260 at expiration
  - Maximum profit: ($260 - $250) × 100 - $500 = $500
- Scenario 4: TSLA rises to $270 at expiration
  - Profit: Still $500 (capped by short call)
  - Excess gains beyond $260 are lost to short call

**When to Use:**
- You're bullish but want to reduce cost
- You want defined risk and reward
- Capital preservation is important
- You expect moderate price increase

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost than simple call purchase
- Defined maximum loss (net debit paid)
- Defined maximum profit (width of strikes - net debit)
- Higher probability of profit than long call alone
- Better risk/reward ratio

**Disadvantages:**
- Profit potential is capped
- More complex than single-leg strategies
- Requires two separate transactions
- May have wider bid-ask spread

**Real-World Application:**
A trader using $5,000 capital could buy 10 spreads instead of 4 long calls, controlling 1,000 shares worth $250,000 with better defined risk.

### Strategy 6: Iron Condor (Income in Range-Bound Market)

**Outlook:** Neutral to slightly bullish or bearish

**Description:** Sell both a call spread (above current price) and put spread (below current price) to profit from a stock staying in a range[1].

**Setup:**
- Sell 1 out-of-the-money call at higher strike
- Buy 1 out-of-the-money call at even higher strike
- Sell 1 out-of-the-money put at lower strike
- Buy 1 out-of-the-money put at even lower strike
- All same expiration

**Profit/Loss Profile:**

See Chart 4: Iron Condor P&L (chart:14)

**Real Example - Using Nvidia:**
- Current NVDA price: $100
- Sell call: Strike $110, receive $3 per share ($300)
- Buy call: Strike $115, pay $1 per share ($100)
- Sell put: Strike $90, receive $3 per share ($300)
- Buy put: Strike $85, pay $1 per share ($100)
- Total Credit Received: $300 + $300 - $100 - $100 = $400
- Scenario 1: NVDA stays between $90-$110 at expiration
  - Maximum profit: $400 (all options expire worthless)
- Scenario 2: NVDA rises to $112 at expiration
  - Loss: ($112 - $110) × 100 - $400 = -$200 (loss starts)
- Scenario 3: NVDA falls to $88 at expiration
  - Loss: ($90 - $88) × 100 - $400 = -$200 (loss starts)
- Scenario 4: NVDA rises to $120 at expiration
  - Maximum loss: ($115 - $110) × 100 - $400 = $100
- Scenario 5: NVDA falls to $80 at expiration
  - Maximum loss: ($90 - $85) × 100 - $400 = $100

**When to Use:**
- Market is expected to stay range-bound
- Implied volatility is high (premiums are fat)
- You want consistent income from a stable stock
- You can actively manage positions

**Advantages:**
- Profitable in non-moving market (high probability)
- Well-defined risk and reward
- Collect premium from both sides
- Lower margin requirements than naked positions
- Can target 50%+ win rate

**Disadvantages:**
- Maximum profit is limited to credit received
- Risk can be larger than profit in worst case
- Requires active management near expiration
- Complex position to manage
- May tie up substantial margin/capital

**Key Point:** Iron condors work best in range-bound markets with high implied volatility at entry.

## 5. Risk Management Principles

### Position Sizing

Never risk more than 2-5% of your trading capital on a single trade[2]. For a $50,000 account:
- 2% = $1,000 maximum risk per trade
- 5% = $2,500 maximum risk per trade

### Using Stop Losses

Set predetermined exit points:

- Close losing positions at 50% of max loss
- Take profits at 50-75% of max profit (don't wait for expiration)
- Use mental or hard stops to enforce discipline

### Volatility Considerations

- **High Volatility:** Premiums are expensive (good for selling options, bad for buying)
- **Low Volatility:** Premiums are cheap (good for buying options, bad for selling)
- **VIX levels:** Check the VIX index (volatility index) before entering trades

### Expiration Management

- Be aware of time decay as expiration approaches
- Theta (time decay) accelerates in final week before expiration
- Don't wait until last day unless you have a specific plan
- Close positions 1-2 weeks before expiration to avoid assignment surprises

### Probability of Profit (PoP)

- **Delta approximates PoP** - A $50 call with 0.30 delta has ~30% chance of profit at expiration
- Target 60%+ PoP for income strategies
- Accept lower PoP (30-40%) for directional bets if risk/reward is good

---

## 6. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Earnings Hedge

**Scenario:** You own 100 shares of Apple at $220. Earnings are in 3 days, and implied volatility is expected to crush 50% after earnings.

**Setup:**
- Own 100 AAPL shares
- Buy 1 put: Strike $210, Premium $2.50, 30 days to expiration
- Cost: $250

**Expected Outcome:**
- If stock stays near $220 before earnings: Premium may rise due to volatility
- If stock drops 10% to $198: Protected by $210 put
- If stock rallies to $240: Participate in gains, only loss is put premium

**Result:** Define risk while participating in upside

---

### Example 2: Generating Income on Cash-Secured Puts

**Scenario:** You have $10,000 in cash and want to generate income.

**Setup:**
- Sell 1 put: Strike $200, Expiration 30 days, Premium $3 per share ($300)
- Keep $20,000 cash reserved (strike × 100 shares)

**Expected Outcome:**
- If stock stays above $200: Premium is yours ($300 profit)
- Annualized return: $300 × 12 = $3,600 per $20,000 = 18% return
- If stock falls to $190: Assigned at $200, own stock below market
- Can then sell covered calls on the assigned shares

---

### Example 3: Bull Call Spread for Limited Capital

**Scenario:** You have only $2,000 to deploy on Nvidia which trades at $100, but want exposure to 1,000 shares worth.

**Setup:**
- Buy 10 bull call spreads
- Buy 10 calls: Strike $100, Premium $8 per share ($800)
- Sell 10 calls: Strike $110, Premium $3 per share ($300)
- Net debit: $500 per spread = $5,000 total
  - Actually $5,000 total, not $2,000 - adjust to fit capital

**Adjusted Setup** (with $2,000):
- Buy 4 bull call spreads
- Buy 4 calls: Strike $100, Premium $8 per share ($3,200)
- Sell 4 calls: Strike $110, Premium $3 per share ($1,200)
- Net debit: $500 × 4 = $2,000

**Outcome:**
- Max profit: $1,000 (if NVDA reaches $110): $100 × 10 width × 4 spreads - $2,000
- Max loss: $2,000
- Capital efficiency: Control $40,000 notional with $2,000 capital

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Buying out-of-the-money options** - Low probability, money disappears quickly
2. **Holding through expiration** - Don't wait; close early to avoid assignment surprises
3. **Ignoring Greeks** - Delta, Theta, and Vega matter for price predictions
4. **Over-leveraging** - Risk only 2-5% per trade
5. **Not understanding assignment** - Short options can be assigned unexpectedly
6. **Selling naked calls** - Unlimited loss potential; requires portfolio margin
7. **Picking earnings plays blindly** - Volatility crush is real after earnings
8. **Not tracking probability** - Use delta as proxy for probability of profit
